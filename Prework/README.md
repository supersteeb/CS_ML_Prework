## Question 1: ANSWER
According to this data, **the body part most closely related to adiposity** is the **abdomen**. To put another way, the best thing to measure to find out how fat one is — that is, how indicative it is of one's "fatness" — is a person's abdomen.

## QUESTION 2: ANSWER
##### The characteristic as it relates to adiposity that changes most between people under 45 and people age 45 and over is:
**Knee** with a value of: 0.10830842534469676

## Bonus: 
Based on the dataset, there are 476 "obese" people in the 20-39 age range, 289 "obsese" people in the 40-59 age range, and 51 "obese" people in the 60-79 age range. Segmentation of the dataset based on multiple criteria was thus successful.
